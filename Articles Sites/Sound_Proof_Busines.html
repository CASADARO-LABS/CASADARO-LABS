        <h1>Custom Focus and Sound Proof Offices & Media Production Spaces</h1>
        
        <p>I understand that you're interested in custom focus and sound proof offices as well as media production spaces. Here is some information that may be helpful:</p>
        
        <h2>Focus and Sound Proof Offices:</h2>
        <p>These are specially designed workspaces intended to provide a distraction-free and acoustically isolated environment. Key features often include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sound absorbing wall and ceiling panels to minimize echoes and dampen external noise</li>
            <li>Solid core doors with seals to block sound transmission</li>
            <li>Sound-rated windows (if any) and extra insulation in walls</li>
            <li>White noise machines or sound masking systems to cover up remaining low level noises</li>
            <li>Minimalist decor to reduce visual distractions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Media Production Spaces:</h2>
        <p>Spaces for producing audio and video content have some overlapping needs with focus offices but additional specialized requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recording studios need sound isolation booths, diffusers, bass traps and acoustic treatment to create ideal recording conditions</li>
            <li>Mixing/mastering rooms require carefully calibrated acoustics and high-end audio monitoring equipment</li>
            <li>Video production may call for green screen cycloramas, lighting grids, sound stages, control rooms, etc. depending on the scale</li>
            <li>Both audio and video spaces typically have additional electrical and HVAC needs to handle the equipment load</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Designing these kinds of custom spaces requires working with architects and contractors who specialize in acoustic design and technical media environments. The specific requirements will vary a lot depending on the intended use, budget, and location.</p>

            <p>Let me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy discuss further aspects of creating focused work environments and media production facilities.</p>
