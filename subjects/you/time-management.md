# HOW TO MANAGE YOUR TIME

## START YOUR DAY WITH YOUR MOST CRITICAL WORK
You chose this work, it is not chosen for you. You have somewhere you want to get. What is the most important thing you can do to help you get there? If the task is large and you don't know where to start. Break your large task down into smaller tasks. 

Everything goes out the window when you have other options.
    
## USE FEEDBACK LOOPS
Constantly think about what you have done and how you can do it better.
Incorporate feedback from other. Preferably negative feedback.
Suround yourself with people that provide consistent and truthful feedback.

## REASON FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES

"it is important to view knowledge as a sort of semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental, the trunk and the big branches, before you get into the leaves or there is nothing for them to hang on to." ~Elon Musk
