    <h1>Web Development</h1>

    <p>
        If you are reasonably intelligent and are interested. This guide is designed to teach you the fundamentals of web develpment so you can build your own websites and web applications.

       A large part of programing is reasoning, planing, research and problem solving. I don't have any statistics, but I would guess that less that 20% of a programmers time is spent writing code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other 80% of the time is spent trying to figure out what to do next, fixing bugs, making improvements and thinking about the proccess.

       So, less say programming is a tool. Like a wand to a wizard, or a gun to gun slinger. Waiving the wand and pulling the trigger are easy. But in order to be effective we have to know magic and we have to know how to aim. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For these reasons the goal should not be to learn the tool, but to aquire a deep interest and intimate knowlege of the concepts, principles, and laws that govern the tool and its effective applications.
