### The Reciprocal 
reciprocals in math, When the product of two fractions are equal to 1, each fraction is said to be the reciprocal of the other fraction.

In Algebra the word "product" is the term used do represent multiplication. 

The reciprocal of a/b is b/a (where a and or b are not equal to 0)

0 = 0/1 but 1/0 is undefined. This means that 0 has no reciprocal.
