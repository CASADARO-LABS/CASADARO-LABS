  <h1 class="page_heading text_align_center text_transform_uppercase">Investment Strategy</h1>
  <p>My investment strategy follows the teaching of <a href="#">Warren Buffet</a>, who studied under <a
      href="#">Benjamin Graham</a> author of <a href="The Intelligent Investor,">"The Intelligent Investor",</a>, and
    last, but not least,<a href="#">Phil Town</a>, Author of <a href="#">"Rule One Investor"</a> and <a
      href="#">"Payback Time"</a>.</a></a></p>

  <p>All together these men and their philosophy compose a school of thought known as value investing.</p>
